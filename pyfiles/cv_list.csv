Tata Steel is one of the largest steel manufacturing companies in the world. My job as an intern was to create an OPC (Open Platform Communication) client for digitizing PLC devices and make an HMI (Human Machine Interface). The software was made in C# and .NET. The client had to connect to an OPC server (OmniServer) and extract data from the device generated information. This was then manipulated and displayed to the administrator via the client. The admin can then further use the obtained data for device maintenance. WORK FROM HOME INTERNSHIP DOCTORI8 8 Internship in Web Development. Doctori8 is a healthcare service provider which enables transparent communication between doctors or hospitals with the patients using the management system. The management system uses a mobile app and a website as an interface. I have worked on both of them. Primarily used HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript and PHP to develop the mobile view. Overall, I optimized the app and website (parts assigned to me) for a more fluid experience. I have also learned about the MVC framework and CodeIgniter from this internship. OWASP STUDENT CHAPTER 2017 ONWARDS Worked closely with OWASP Student Chapter for spreading awareness about cyber security and gaining experience in the field. Notable Projects Face Detection and Recognition in Python A customizable face detection and recognition model which can recognize faces once the model has run over known faces. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network to identify faces. The know images with their names have to be placed in the folder. The model iterates over all the images in that folder, and can then detect faces, even if the faces are sideways or at an angle. This was followed by a research paper for the same. Image Denoising and Smoothing in CUDA This program is written in CUDA and C++, and can smoothen any input figure using the Mean filter. For preprocessing the data, the image is first convolved with a Sobel filter, then a sharpening filter and finally finished with a mean filter. Social Network Project with OOP in PHP A social networking website which has a lot of functionality and is programmed in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ajax and PHP. The PHP written is using the OOP layout. One can use it to chat with followers, get live feed on their timeline whenever a follower posts something, get notifications, upload text and images in the timeline. This project is set up on localhost but with suitable modifications, can be broadcasted in the Internet. A 3D cube simulator which is written in C# and made in Unity 3D. It uses the basic algorithm to solve the Rubik's Cube. It was our data structure project. My responsibility was to create the GUI to implement the cube algorithm. The cube can rotate in 3D, and individual user moves can also be done. In addition, the number of moves and time taken is also displayed if the cube is set to be solved on its own.

Tata Steel is one of the largest steel manufacturing companies in the world. My job as an intern was to create an OPC (Open Platform Communication) client for digitizing PLC devices and make an HMI (Human Machine Interface). The software was made in C# and .NET. The client had to connect to an OPC server (OmniServer) and extract data from the device generated information. This was then manipulated and displayed to the administrator via the client. The admin can then further use the obtained data for device maintenance. WORK FROM HOME INTERNSHIP DOCTORI8 8 Internship in Web Development. Doctori8 is a healthcare service provider which enables transparent communication between doctors or hospitals with the patients using the management system. The management system uses a mobile app and a website as an interface. I have worked on both of them. Primarily used HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript and PHP to develop the mobile view. Overall, I optimized the app and website (parts assigned to me) for a more fluid experience. I have also learned about the MVC framework and CodeIgniter from this internship. OWASP STUDENT CHAPTER 2017 ONWARDS Worked closely with OWASP Student Chapter for spreading awareness about cyber security and gaining experience in the field. Notable Projects Face Detection and Recognition in Python A customizable face detection and recognition model which can recognize faces once the model has run over known faces. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network to identify faces. The know images with their names have to be placed in the folder. The model iterates over all the images in that folder, and can then detect faces, even if the faces are sideways or at an angle. This was followed by a research paper for the same. Image Denoising and Smoothing in CUDA This program is written in CUDA and C++, and can smoothen any input figure using the Mean filter. For preprocessing the data, the image is first convolved with a Sobel filter, then a sharpening filter and finally finished with a mean filter. Social Network Project with OOP in PHP A social networking website which has a lot of functionality and is programmed in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ajax and PHP. The PHP written is using the OOP layout. One can use it to chat with followers, get live feed on their timeline whenever a follower posts something, get notifications, upload text and images in the timeline. This project is set up on localhost but with suitable modifications, can be broadcasted in the Internet. A 3D cube simulator which is written in C# and made in Unity 3D. It uses the basic algorithm to solve the Rubik's Cube. It was our data structure project. My responsibility was to create the GUI to implement the cube algorithm. The cube can rotate in 3D, and individual user moves can also be done. In addition, the number of moves and time taken is also displayed if the cube is set to be solved on its own.

Tata Steel is one of the largest steel manufacturing companies in the world. My job as an intern was to create an OPC (Open Platform Communication) client for digitizing PLC devices and make an HMI (Human Machine Interface). The software was made in C# and .NET. The client had to connect to an OPC server (OmniServer) and extract data from the device generated information. This was then manipulated and displayed to the administrator via the client. The admin can then further use the obtained data for device maintenance. WORK FROM HOME INTERNSHIP DOCTORI8 8 Internship in Web Development. Doctori8 is a healthcare service provider which enables transparent communication between doctors or hospitals with the patients using the management system. The management system uses a mobile app and a website as an interface. I have worked on both of them. Primarily used HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript and PHP to develop the mobile view. Overall, I optimized the app and website (parts assigned to me) for a more fluid experience. I have also learned about the MVC framework and CodeIgniter from this internship. OWASP STUDENT CHAPTER 2017 ONWARDS Worked closely with OWASP Student Chapter for spreading awareness about cyber security and gaining experience in the field. Notable Projects Face Detection and Recognition in Python A customizable face detection and recognition model which can recognize faces once the model has run over known faces. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network to identify faces. The know images with their names have to be placed in the folder. The model iterates over all the images in that folder, and can then detect faces, even if the faces are sideways or at an angle. This was followed by a research paper for the same. Image Denoising and Smoothing in CUDA This program is written in CUDA and C++, and can smoothen any input figure using the Mean filter. For preprocessing the data, the image is first convolved with a Sobel filter, then a sharpening filter and finally finished with a mean filter. Social Network Project with OOP in PHP A social networking website which has a lot of functionality and is programmed in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ajax and PHP. The PHP written is using the OOP layout. One can use it to chat with followers, get live feed on their timeline whenever a follower posts something, get notifications, upload text and images in the timeline. This project is set up on localhost but with suitable modifications, can be broadcasted in the Internet. A 3D cube simulator which is written in C# and made in Unity 3D. It uses the basic algorithm to solve the Rubik's Cube. It was our data structure project. My responsibility was to create the GUI to implement the cube algorithm. The cube can rotate in 3D, and individual user moves can also be done. In addition, the number of moves and time taken is also displayed if the cube is set to be solved on its own.
